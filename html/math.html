						We prove that for a large class of algebraic effects, the corresponding skip-free process calculus consisting of branching operations, sequential composition, and a relatively small family of "two-variable" star operations is complete with respect to bisimilarity.
						The argument is a category-theoretic rendering of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12740" target="_blank">an earlier completeness proof due to Grabmayer and Fokkink</a> and uses results from coalgebra. 
						Our completeness proof specifically goes through for algebraic effects presented by what we call <i>supported</i> and <i>malleable</i> algebraic theories.
						This generalizes the completeness theorem of skip-free GKAT and presents new completeness theorems for several other calculi, including probabilistic and weighted ones.

						We give a bialgebraic characterization of the stream semantics of probabilistic labelled transition systems (i.e., of the form <i>X &RightArrow; &Dscr;(A &times; X)</i>) and show properness of the coalgebraic signature on the underlying algebraic category <i>Alg(&Dscr;)</i> of convex algebras.
						This allows us to prove that the axioms of trace measure equivalence for probabilistic process terms are also complete for stream measure equivalence.

						We forge connections between the theory of fractal sets obtained as attractors of iterated function systems and process calculi. To this end, we reinterpret Milner's expressions for processes as contraction operators on a complete metric space. When the space is, for example, the plane, the denotations of fixed point terms correspond to familiar fractal sets. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of fractal equivalence, the congruence on terms consisting of pairs that construct identical self-similar sets in all interpretations. We further make connections to labelled Markov chains and to invariant measures. In all of this work, we use important results from process calculi. For example, we use Rabinovich's completeness theorem for trace equivalence in our own completeness theorem. In addition to our results, we also raise many questions related to both fractals and process calculi.

						We introduce Probabilistic Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (ProbGKAT), an extension of GKAT that allows reasoning about uninterpreted imperative programs with probabilistic branching. We give its operational semantics in terms of special class of probabilistic automata. We give a sound and complete Salomaa-style axiomatisation of bisimilarity of ProbGKAT expressions. Finally, we show that bisimilarity of ProbGKAT expressions can be decided in O(n^3log(n)) time via a generic partition refinement algorithm.

						Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) is a fragment of Kleene Algebra with Tests (KAT) that was recently introduced to reason efficiently about imperative programs. In contrast to KAT, GKAT does not have an algebraic axiomatization, but relies on an analogue of Salomaa's axiomatization of Kleene Algebra. In this paper, we present an algebraic axiomatization and prove two completeness results for a large fragment of GKAT in the form of skip-free programs.

						This was the culmination of what was essentially an undergraduate thesis, funded by a Jamie Cassels Undergraduate Research Award. The primary result is that minimal projectivity and unitary conjugation are definable in the language of C*-algebras, but are inexpressible without quantifiers.
						Furthermore, adding them to the language is sufficient for quantifier eliination in finite-dimensional C*-algberas (and in fact, only minimal projectivity is needed for the matrix algebras).

					<div class="abstract"><b class="hoverreq">(Hover for abstract)</b><br />
						It came to the attention of myself and the coauthors of (S., Rozowski, Silva, Rot, 2022) that a number of process calculi can be obtained by algebraically presenting the branching structure of the transition systems they specify. Labelled transition systems, for example, branch into sets of transitions, terms in the free semilattice generated by the transitions. Interpreting equational theories in the category of sets has undesirable limitations, and we would like to have more examples of presentations in other categories. In this brief article, I discuss monad presentations in the category of partially ordered sets and monotone maps. I focus on quantitative monads, namely free modules over ordered semirings, and give sufficient conditions for one of these to lift a monad on the category of sets.

						A (Co)algebraic Framework for Ordered Processes
					</a></i>
					<div class="abstract"><b class="hoverreq">(Hover for abstract)</b><br />
						A recently published paper (Schmid, Rozowski, Silva, and Rot, 2022) offers a (co)algebraic framework for studying processes with algebraic branching structures and recursion operators. The framework captures Milner's algebra of regular behaviours (Milner, 1984) but fails to give an honest account of a closely related calculus of probabilistic processes (Stark and Smolka, 1999). We capture Stark and Smolka's calculus by giving an alternative framework, aimed at studying a family of ordered process calculi with inequationally specified branching structures and recursion operators. We observe that a recent probabilistic extension of guarded Kleene algebra with tests (Rozowski, Kozen, Kappe, Schmid, Silva, 2022) is a fragment of one of our calculi, along with other examples. We also compare the intrinsic order in our process calculi with the notion of similarity in coalgebra.
