			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of Bucknell University</a>.
				I am passionate about inclusive STEM education, the mathematical foundations of computer science, and youth outreach. 
				I used to be an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.stmarys-ca.edu/academics/science/math-computer-science" target="_blank">Mathematics and Computer Science Department of St. Mary's College of California</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				I completed my PhD in 2023 as a part of the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/" target="_blank">PPLV group</a> in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department of University College London</a>. 
				My supervisers were the superstars <a href="https://www.alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html" target="_blank">Alexandra Silva</a> and <a href="http://jurriaan.me/" target="_blank">Jurriaan Rot</a>.
				My PhD thesis is titled <a href="thesis.pdf" target="_blank"><i>Coalgebraic Completeness Theorems for Effectful Process Algebras</i></a>, and offers a general framework for axiomatizing process algebras that consist of action sequencing operators, an algebraic effect, and recursion.
				One of the main contributions of the framework, I would say, is how it handles unguarded recursive specifications.
				The work generalizes the completeness theorem for Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests, or <i>GKAT</i>, from <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05920" target="_blank">(Smolka et al, 2019)</a>.
				Effectful process algebras are closely connected but orthogonal to the calculi studied in <a href="https://alexandrasilva.org/files/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">Alexandra's PhD thesis</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Interests</b><br />
				I am generally interested in universal algebra and coalgebra, iteration theory, and process algebra, but on occasion I am willing to admit to my obession with generative systems of the form \(X \to MFX\), where \(M\) is a monad of some kind and \(F\) is some polynomial functor.
				I spend a lot of time thinking about monad presentations and final coalgebras.
				Recently, I have been working with behavioural differential equations, algebraic approaches to trace semantics, and lattices.
				I used to work with fractals and generative music.
				I still do, but I used to too.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we happen share interests, please write! 
				I'm always happy to make a new pen pal.

				Outside of theoretical computer science, I <a href="https://toddtoddtodd.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">make electronic music</a>, think about rescue dogs, and climb.

						In September of last year, <a href="https://tobias.kap.pe/" target="_blank">Tobias Kappé</a> found a hole in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30044-8_12" target="_blank">the completeness proof for skip-free GKAT that we published at ESOP 2023</a> along with <a href="https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html" target="_blank">Alexandra Silva</a>.
						Thankfully, we had another completeness proof (using a different technique) in our pocket, so we knew that the result was still correct, at least. 
						But we wanted to fix the proof technique we used <i>in that paper</i>, so we went to work.
						Soon after, we produced the completeness proof that appeared in <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10185006/" target="_blank">my thesis</a>.
						We just put a new and improved, polished and presentable version of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11301" target="_blank">on arXiv</a>.
						The proof ended up being much harder (and even more interesting) than we thought.
